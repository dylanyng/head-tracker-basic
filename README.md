Head Tracker is an early iteration of a migraine and headache tracking web application. 

**Link to project:** Demo coming soon...


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, EJS, CSS

Head Tracker is a beginner level application created for educational purposes. A fully featured migraine tracker is currently in the planning phase. 


# Packages/Dependencies used 

- cors
- dotenv
- ejs
- express
- helper-js
- mongodb


## Optimizations

- [ ] Add the ability to edit past logs.
- [ ] Disable the ability to submit a log for a day that has an existing log.
- [ ] Add new log option for medications while distinguishing between common and less common medication types (abortives vs preventatives).
- [ ] Make rows static to indicate day of the week.


# Installation

- `npm install` 
- Create a `.env` file and add the following as `DB_STRING = <connection string>`


## Lessons Learned:

- My template for basic applications needs updating. Better separation and organization is a must. Future applications will be built with MVC structure.
